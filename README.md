# DJ Song Requests

Simple demo implementation of a real-time song request queue built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript.

## Features
- Public request form
- Queue page with live refresh
- Admin drag & drop view
- API routes for requests, votes and admin actions
- Prisma schema & seed

## Development
```
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run dev
```

### Database
The project uses PostgreSQL via the existing `docker-compose.yml`.

```
npm run db:up       # start postgres (hostname: localhost, port: 5432)
npm run db:wait     # wait until it is ready
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run db:seed
```

## Testing
```
npm test
```

## Environment
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values for database and realtime providers.

Set `DJ_ADMIN_TOKEN` and use the same token via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or by logging in at `/login` to access `/admin`.

### Manual tests
- Dragging a card between columns persists the new status.
- Reordering cards within a column persists the new `sortIndex`.

## Deployment
Deploy on Vercel and connect to a PostgreSQL database (e.g. Supabase).
